# ArtewaldEngine
ArtewaldEngine is a low-level game engine. The engine is still in its early development stage and lacks a lot of features.

The game engine uses a voxel-based raytracing renderer. The rendered "world" consists of chunks containing oct-trees of voxels.
## Features (WIP)
- [x] Ray tracing
- [x] Generate oct-tree with voxels
- [ ] Path tracing
- [ ] Physics based rendering
- [ ] Store and load chunks
- [ ] World physics
- [ ] Procedural terrain generation
- [ ] Add GUI for easier debugging
- [ ] Add 3D movement
